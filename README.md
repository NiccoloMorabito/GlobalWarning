# Global Warning: A Look at the Impact of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Climate

The project "Global Warning" and this website are part of the work carried out for the Visual Analytics course (AY 2022/2023) at the CentraleSup√©lec university. The purpose is to provide hands-on experience designing and implementing a useful visualization tool.

The data for the visualizations above is taken from [ClimateWatch](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/) and [EM-Dat](https://www.emdat.be/).

The website with the visualizations is available [here](https://niccolomorabito.github.io/GlobalWarning/).

### Abstract
The project aims to visually study the trends and the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and the consequences of climate change, such as natural disasters and extreme weather events. The purpose is to raise awareness of the threat of climate change and encourage action to mitigate its effects.

The technical realization of the project involves several stages, including data collection, data cleansing, and the design and implementation of the visualizations. Thanks to the three resulting visualization (one for introducing the causes, one for the consequences and the last one for studying the link between them), it is possible to get a precise idea of the patterns in gas emissions and natural disasters and to analyze the distribution of the two over time and space.

The results of the research can finally be explored by using various encoding techniques aiming to provide a clear and impacting overview of the causes, the consequences and the relationship between them, both in the past and in the current situation and verify the hypothesis on the data.

### Introduction
According to the [Global Attitudes Survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/08/31/climate-change-remains-top-global-threat-across-19-country-survey/), one in four people in the surveyed countries still does not consider global climate change a major threat to society.

In recent years, Europe has experienced a range of extreme weather events, from droughts and heatwaves to floods and storms, and the rest is affected continuously by natural disasters as well. These intense and frequent occurrences serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for action on climate change. Moreover, they also show that the data collected over the last century, and currently being collected, could reveal an alarming pattern in the climate, and this could help to educate end engage both the uninformed and skeptics about the threat, by providing them with a quick and impactful overview that highlights the validity of the scientific community's decades-long hypothesis.

The project aims to investigate what is the relationship between the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and the consequences of climate change (in terms of the frequency of natural disasters and extreme weather and temperature events) in the last century. The final purpose is to raise awareness of one of the biggest threats of our times among people who may not be fully informed and encourage them to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change. 

The visualizations will address and try to answer the following research questions:
* What is the relation between the consequences of climate change (droughts, floods, extreme temperatures, etc.) and the emissions of GHG in different countries in the last 100 years?
* Are the consequences homogeneously and/or proportionally distributed in the world according to the GHG emissions?
* What are the global trends in GHG emissions over time?
* How are the different types of climate disasters evolving over time?
* Does climate change affect different countries differently?
